1. 创建两个新组件: UserInput和UserOutput
2. UserInput含有一个input字段,UserOutput有两段
3. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
4. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
5. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
6. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
7. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
8. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
9. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
